# modelling_legal_text

This repository contains notebooks where I experiment with applying topic modelling to EU legal texts taken from the EU's official journal.

Most of the notebooks deal with data processing.

The notebook ['gensim_18_19_20.ipynb'](gensim_18_19_20.ipynb) shows the result of applying a LDA topic modeller on the texts.
